An aggregation of Android Studio projects that I've created over the years. 
Includes:

* SoundBoard application which utilizes SharedPreferences to store audio recordings and simplistic interface to play those many recordings at a press of a button
* Camera app which leverages TensorFlow's built-in face detection and object detection software and the Android camera API
* 2018 Computer Fair submission meant to help younger generations gain an understanding of artificial intelligence, its uses, and limitations.
* Tic Tac Toe app which implements an attractive UI and bot opponent for single-player gameplay
